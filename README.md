# LoRATSF: Modeling Long-term Time Series Forecasting with *1k* Parameters using LoRA

**LoRATSF** (Lightweight Long-term Time Series Forecasting) is my final project for the Python course in my **second year of Nankai University**. 

This project is based on the previous [**SparseTSF** model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00946) (LSS et al., 2024), 
with optimizations and improvements aimed at further reducing the model's parameter count, 
focusing purely on minimizing the number of parameters without compromising the model's predictive power. 


## Related Work

**LoRATSF** builds upon the **SparseTSF** model, which introduced a novel approach to time series forecasting, featuring:

- **Lightweight design**: The model has **100** parameters, making it orders of magnitude smaller than other models.
- **Decoupling of periodicity and trends**: Through **Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting**, LoRATSF effectively separates periodic and trend components in time series data like SparseTSF.
- **Excellent generalization capability**: LoRATSF has shown outstanding cross-domain generalization ability across multiple datasets, especially in scenarios with limited computational resources or smaller datasets like SparseTSF.

The reference for **SparseTSF** is as follows:

## Project Background

This project is my final assignment for the Python course, aimed at exploring some probabilities to build an efficient long-term time series forecasting model. 
The advantages of this model are:

*   **Few parameters**: Making it deployable in resource-constrained environments.

## Project Objectives

1.  **Optimize the SparseTSF model** to minimize its parameters.
2.  **Demonstrate the modelâ€™s performance** on multiple time series datasets, including traffic data, electricity load, etc.

## Environment Setup

Ensure that you have Conda installed on your system, and then configure your environment as follows:

```bash
conda create -n LoRATSF python=3.8
conda activate LoRATSF
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation
